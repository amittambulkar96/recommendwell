Recommendation letters work best when they follow a clear, predictable structure. This outline keeps your letter focused and credible.

## Paragraph 1: Relationship and role

State who you are, how you know the candidate, and how long you have worked together. This sets your authority and context.

## Paragraph 2: Evidence and examples

Share 1-2 concrete examples that show the candidate's skills or character. Focus on impact, results, and observed behavior.

## Paragraph 3: Fit for the opportunity

Connect the evidence to the role, program, or scholarship. Explain why the candidate is a strong fit for what comes next.

## Paragraph 4: Closing endorsement

Reaffirm your recommendation, provide a way to contact you, and close professionally.

## Quick checklist

- Relationship is clear
- Evidence is specific
- Tone matches the audience
