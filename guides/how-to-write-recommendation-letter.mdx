Writing a recommendation letter is easier when you focus on evidence, structure, and clarity. Use this guide to build a letter that feels authentic and persuasive.

## Start with the relationship

Open by stating who you are, how you know the candidate, and the length of your relationship. This establishes credibility and context.

## Share 2-3 proof points

Pick specific achievements or behaviors. Use short examples that show impact, not just praise.

## Match the opportunity

Align the evidence with the program, job, or scholarship requirements. Mention the traits that matter most for the audience.

## Keep the structure simple

- Opening paragraph: relationship and endorsement
- Middle paragraphs: evidence and examples
- Final paragraph: strong closing and contact details

## Review the tone

Aim for professional, confident language that still sounds like you. Remove vague claims and replace them with details.

## Use a checklist

- Correct name, role, and dates
- Clear endorsement
- Relevant evidence
- Contact information
